Went over the sample audit history  and looked at the sample product version and product spec configuration.

ROOT CAUSE: 
There is an action limit set on the A1_UnspecifiedImpurity01. Since PMPA is an unspecified impurity, the action limit was applied during calculation.
However, in the paper spec there is a statement that PMPA is one of the impurities to be exempt from the action limit.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: 
User instructed to just close the investigation and proceed with authorization of the test citing the product spec document as justification to ignore the action limit.

FINAL RESOLUTION: 
Impurity PMPA for samples got flagged as OOC. SPEC-M0554 has an action limit placed on unspec impurities. However PMPA is exempt from action limits. User instructed to close investigation citing paper spec. User confirms they are able to continue."

I went by the instrument and was able to power on the instrument with no issue.  

the problem that you encountered might be due to the he way safety circuity work on the washer vessel. 

when the instrument gets powered down and unplugged from the wall socket. the main power plug need to be reset (push the reset button) this will resume power continuity to the instrument.  once that's established you can turn on the on switch behind the back of the instrument. 

I tested the instrument by powering it on and off 3x, performed 1x 500ml flush and did not encounter any issues. 

let me know if you need any additional help and please feel free to reach out directly and ill be glad to demonstrate this for you as well. 

Thanks,
Evan"

Please take a look and help solve the issue. need to close today or tomorrow. 
************************
LIMS help due Wed Feb 5 2020.  they need time to review before release due on friday""
INVESTIGATIVE ACTIONS:
Reproduced issue in SUP - transfer files consumed by LabStation but no data entered. Reviewed data files - no issues observed. Observed basic.log file in LabStation client folder contains 'Runtime error:  does not understand: grades' with apparent reference to Lot_Sampling_Point record having Product Version = '0'. Second transfer in SUP was successful, however.
ROOT CAUSE:
TBD via RCA.
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
Requested user to re-transfer, first same files as previously and also files containing only second sample (3652809). Raised TASK1037305 for root-cause analysis.
FINAL RESOLUTION:

Is it possible to remove them or is there something else in the background preventing the sample to be shown as complete (ready for review)? I asked Jean to try to remove these fields but it is also grayed out for her. If possible, could this be resolved by Monday? We need to close out the sample and ELN, in order to close the lab investigation.

INC1021404,Incident,RnD UV Vis peripheral shows fatal error,UV Vis,2 - High,FC Lab Operations L1,Nathaniel Gagaza,Chris Qiu,02/21/20,04/24/20,63,instrument maintain/part replace,"Issue: unit displays flashing red light and displays ""fatal error"" in LabX.
Technician remarks:  Upon initial check, autosampler would not go to home position after initial start up. Tower
would only move slightly up and down but arm and tray would not move at all. New arm
motor board and arm sensor board installed. Unit continued to have the same issue. Old
boards reinstalled back into the unit. Spindles connected to the motors on the tower and
arm inspected. Noticed that spindle on the arm was not spinning easily. Drove both
spindles up and down. Inspected to make sure all cables were fully connected. Reset arm
spindle to the home position and tower spindle to the center. Unit restarted and tested. Unit
then automatically went to home position after start up and tray was once again operating.
Lights flashed with the correct sequence.
Performed diagnostic test on autosampler using Lars software. Unit passed tested
parameters.
